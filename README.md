fraise is a very small mobile app that I made because [this app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/party-catchphrase/id1088619695) is really bad. It's by no means a great app, but it was a good exercise for me to re-learn Swift and the new iOS app development cycle.

If you have any improvements at all, I encourage you to submit a PR or an issue, but I can't guarantee that I'll do any more work on this app - it's just here for fun.

## privacy policy

fraise doesn't collect or store any data from the app, other than data collected by Apple for app analytics. Should fraise ever want to collect or store any data from any of its users, it will always notify them ahead of time and only do so with their explicit consent.
